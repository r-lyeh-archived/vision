# premises
a few assorted premises and thoughts

# player dogmas
- candy the eye
- touch the heart
- master the brain

# game dogma
- sorted by importance: content > mechanics > code

# dev dogmas
- democracy { art, code, design }
- brainstorming: everybody in shared triangle edges 
- voting: rule 2-of-3 
- own your production

# dual organization
- designers: both mechanics and levels
- concepts: both textures and skinning
- coders: both tech and gameplay
- animators: both model and animation
- musicians: both music and sounds
- leads: both project and human resources
- producers: nope
- managers: nope
- HQ / staff / vip: nope

# inverse project flow
classic: staff requests features, workers do. loop forever. infinite development cycle. nonsense everywhere.
inverse: workers request features, staff approves or maybe not, devs do only if approved.

# plus (when hiring)
- master of two: artsy coder, technical artist, game+level designer

# milestones & planning

1. do video-in-max while( !approved )

# physical layout
